      <div class="box"> <h1><strong>A Legend of Native Lore</strong></h1><br><br><p>As a native of the Western Hemisphere, the hummingbird is a common character in the legends and myths of Native American peoples. In many native tribes, the hummingbird is associated with stories about love. The Mayans believed that the sun once adopted the disguise of a hummingbird in order to court a beautiful woman, who turned out to actually be the moon in disguise.

      <div class="box"> <h1><strong>A Rainmaker</strong></h1><br><br><p>In many Native American legends, hummingbirds intervene with the gods to bring rain. Because of this, people from tribes such as the Hopi often paint hummingbirds on water jars. One Pueblo legend says that the hummingbirdâ€™s bright colors came from rainbows emanating from rain clouds. Hummingbird feathers are often used in rain rituals as well.

      <div class="box"> <h1><strong>A Symbol of Renewal</strong></h1><br><br><p>For this reason the hummingbird is often seen as a symbol of regeneration. The Mojave people believed that in primordial times, people lived in an underground world of darkness, so they dispatched a hummingbird aboveground to find light for them; upon his return he led them through a secret path to live in the sunlight forever. The hummingbird is the creature that opens our hearts to love, beauty, possibility, vitality and the sweetness of life. Though small, the hummingbird is bright and full of power.
