        <p><em>Emily Dickinson</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        A route of evanescence
        <br>
        With a revolving wheel;
        <br>
        A resonance of emerald,
        <br>
        A rush of cochineal;
        <br>
        And every blossom on the bush
        <br>
        Adjusts its tumbled head, —
        <br>
        The mail from Tunis, probably,
        <br>
        An easy morning's ride.

        <p><em>Elaine Terranova</em>
        </p>
        <p>
        What with foresight and dancing,
        gypsies would seem to pass easily
        between worlds. The hummingbird too—
        <br>
        only a moth with a beak—
        Have I ever heard it hum?
        <br>
        Yet it’s everywhere welcome,
        coaxed by red flowers, even sugar water,
        for we are devious, in our desires.
        <br>
        And the dead, we embody them
        for our own purposes. I can’t talk
        to a shadow, to an abstraction.
        <br>
        A sun worshiper, my brother,
        always raising his face to it.
        One touch and the body roar quieted.
        <br>
        Now, though I walk the length
        of the park, he is not there.
        He is nowhere under the sun.
        <br>
        I want the dead but I am with
        the living. The tulips raise up their hands.
        The lunch crowd swallows me.

      <div class="box"> <h1><strong>Ode to the Hummingbird</strong></h1>
      <p><em>Pablo Neruda</em>
      </p>
        <p>
        The hummingbird
        in flight
        is a water-spark,
        an incandescent drip
        of American
        fire,
        the jungle's
        flaming resume,
        a heavenly,
        precise
        rainbow:
        the hummingbird is
        an arc,
        a golden
        thread,
        a green
        bonfire!
        <br>
        <br>
        Oh
        tiny
        living
        lightning,
        when
        you hover
        in the air,
        you are
        a body of pollen,
        a feather
        or hot coal,
        I ask you:
        What is your substance?
        Perhaps during the blind age
        of the Deluge,
        within fertility's
        mud,
        when the rose
        crystallized
        in an anthracite fist,
        and metals matriculated
        each one in
        a secret gallery
        perhaps then
        from a wounded reptile
        some fragment rolled,
        a golden atom,
        the last cosmic scale,
        a drop of terrestrial fire
        took flight,
        suspending your splendor,
        your iridescent,
        swift sapphire.
        <br>
        <br>
        You doze
        on a nut,
        fit into a diminutive blossom;
        you are an arrow,
        a pattern,
        a coat-of-arms,
        honey's vibrato, pollen's ray;
        you are so stouthearted--
        the falcon
        with his black plumage
        does not daunt you:
        you pirouette,
        a light within the light,
        air within the air.
        Wrapped in your wings,
        you penetrate the sheath
        of a quivering flower,
        not fearing
        that her nuptial honey
        may take off your head!
        <br>
        <br>
        From scarlet to dusty gold,
        to yellow flames,
        to the rare
        ashen emerald,
        to the orange and black velvet
        of our girdle gilded by sunflowers,
        to the sketch
        like
        amber thorns,
        your Epiphany,
        little supreme being,
        you are a miracle,
        shimmering
        from torrid California
        to Patagonia's whistling,
        bitter wind.
        You are a sun-seed,
        plumed
        fire,
        a miniature
        flag
        in flight,
        a petal of silenced nations,
        a syllable
        of buried blood,
        a feather
        of an ancient heart,
        submerged.
